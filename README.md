# GB Emu

GB Emu is a long-term emulation project of the classic Nintendo Gameboy. The Gameboy has a Z80 CPU,
a 160x140 LCD, and swappable memory banks built into the cartridge. Because the opcodes are not fixed
width, and the program in memory can self-modify and swap addresses via the bank system, building a
stable debugger and disassembler was absolutely essential. </p>
